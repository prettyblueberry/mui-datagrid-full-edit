## Overview

`mui-datagrid-full-edit` is a fully functional grid component with create, read, update and delete (CRUD) functionality. However, you can use it very simply with just a few prop settings.

It provides an easy way to use `@mui/x-data-grid`. If you think `@mui/x-data-grid` would be good for your admin page but find it a bit difficult, `mui-datagrid-full-edit` would be the best choice. 

It can offer you a great React data grid that is easy to use but comes with full functionality. It comes with features such as pagination, column hiding, CSV and Excel export options, and advanced filtering by default.

> `mui-datagrid-full-edit`'s toolbar has an export button to download grid data as an `Excel` file (\*.`xlsx`). `@mui/x-data-grid-pro` and `@mui/x-data-premium` provide this feature for a license fee, but `mui-datagrid-full-edit` provides it at no cost.

> The current version of `mui-datagrid-full-edit` depends on **v7.25.0** of `@mui/x-data-grid`.

### Install

```bash
$ npm install mui-datagrid-full-edit
```

or

```bash
$ yarn add mui-datagrid-full-edit
```

### Simple Usage

Here is an example of `mui-datagrid-full-edit`.

```javascript
import FullEditDataGrid from "mui-datagrid-full-edit";

...

<FullEditDataGrid
    columns={columns}
    rows={rows}
    onSaveRow={onSaveRow}
    onDeleteRow={onDeleteRow}
    createRowData={createRowData}
/>
```

> _columns_, _rows_, _onSaveRow_, _onDeleteRow_, _createRowData_ are required props.

#### Props

- `columns` (Array): Definition of grid header. It is the same as `@mui/x-data-grid` and the documentation is [here](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/column-definition/).


  Here is an example of `columns`.

  ```javascript
  const columns = [
    {
      field: "id",
      headerName: "Id",
      width: 50,
      hide: true,
      align: "center",
      type: "number",
      editable: false,
    },
    {
      field: "title",
      headerName: "Title",
      width: 150,
      headerAlign: "center",
      type: "string",
      align: "center",
      editable: true,
    },
    {
      field: "dateCreated",
      headerName: "DateCreated",
      width: 150,
      headerAlign: "center",
      type: "date",
      editable: false,
      align: "center",
      renderCell: ({ value }) => moment(value).format("MM/DD/yyyy"),
    },
  ];
  ```

- `rows` (Array): data of the grid.

  Here is an example of `rows`.

  ```javascript
  let rows = [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: "Cycle-Depot",
      dateCreated: new Date("2023-03-09"),
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "Top Lowrider",
      dateCreated: new Date("2023-03-09"),
    },
  ];
  ```

- `onSaveRow` (Function): save action handler. When you do save action on the grid, this handler will be performed.

  The function is for server communication. If your saving on server is success, you need to update rows in the function to repaint the result of communication.

  Here is an example of `onSaveRow`.

  ```javascript
  const [rows, setRows] = useState([]);

  ...

  /*
      id: id value of saved row
      updateRow: entire data or saved row
      rows: all entire old rows of grid
      oldRow: data of row before you update.
  */
  const onSaveRow = (id, updatedRow, oldRow, oldRows) => {
  sellerController // server communication controller
    .saveRow(updatedRow) // send row data of the component
    .then((res) => {
      console.log("server saving success!");
      const dbRow = res.data; // get exact row data of server from response
      setRows(oldRows.map((r) => (r.id === updatedRow.id ? { ...dbRow } : r))); // syncronize server and component
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log("server saving failed!");
      setRows(oldRows); // update nothing on component by old rows
    });
  };
  ```

- `onDeleteRow` (Function): delete action handler. When you do delete action on the grid, this handler will be performed.

  The function is for server communication. If your deleting on server is success, you need to update rows in the function to repaint the result of communication.

  Here is an example of `onDeleteRow`.

  ```javascript
  const [rows, setRows] = useState([]);

  ...

  /*
      id: id value of deleted row
      oldRow: data of row before you update.
      rows: all entire old rows of grid
  */
  const onDeleteRow = (id, oldRow, oldRows) => {
  sellerController
    .deleteRow(id)
    .then((res) => {
      console.log("server deleting success!");
      const dbRowId = res.data.id; // get exact deleted id of server from response
      setRows(oldRows.filter((r) => r.id !== dbRowId)); // remove row in component
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.log("server deleting failed!");
      setRows(oldRows); // update nothing on component by old rows
    });
  };
  ```

- `createRowData` (Function): function to generate data of new row. When you do create new row action, new row will be inserted with data from the function into the component.
  You can unset this prop. If you unset, new data will have only max id value by default.
  Here is an example of `createRowData`.
  ```javascript
  /*
      rows: all entire old rows of grid
  */
  const createRowData = (oldRows) => {
    const newId = Math.max(...rows.map((r) => (r.id ? r.id : 0) * 1)) + 1;
    return { id: newId, title: "Default Name" };
  };
  ```
  
- `noActionColumn` (boolean): hide/show action column.
  ```javascript
  /*
      a grid without an action column
  */
  <FullEditDataGrid
      columns={columns}
      rows={rows}
      onSaveRow={onSaveRow}
      onDeleteRow={onDeleteRow}
      createRowData={createRowData}
      noActionColumn        
  />
  ```
  
- `slotToolbar` (ReactComponent): customized toolbar component. You can customize the default toolbar of `mui-datagrid-full-edit` by passing your own component to the `slotToolbar` prop. This prop takes a React component that will be rendered in place of the default toolbar.

  #### How to Create a Custom Toolbar
  
  1. Copy the default toolbar code:  
     Look at the [default toolbar source](./src/lib/components/DefaultToolbar.js) to see how the internal toolbar is implemented. You can copy and modify its code to suit your needs.
  
  2. Customize the logic:
     - Add or remove buttons (e.g., hide the "Add" button if you donâ€™t need to create new rows).
     - Include any additional elements you want (e.g., custom export buttons, filters, or other UI controls).
     - If you wish to include Excel export functionality, you must import `GridExcelExportMenuItem` from `"mui-datagrid-full-edit/GridExcelExportMenuItem"`.
       
     [Here](./src/CustomToolbar.js) is an example of a customized toolbar component - the component has no "Add" button.
  
  3. Use your custom toolbar:
   ```jsx
   import FullEditDataGrid from "mui-datagrid-full-edit";
   import CustomToolbar from "./CustomToolbar";

   const ExampleGrid = () => {
     return (
       <FullEditDataGrid
         columns={columns}
         rows={rows}
         onSaveRow={onSaveRow}
         onDeleteRow={onDeleteRow}
         createRowData={createRowData}
         slotToolbar={CustomToolbar}
       />
     );
   };
   export default ExampleGrid;
  ```
    

### Advanced Usage

If you want more functions in the component, you can use any props of `@mui/x-data-grid` on this component element.

In this case, you need to know props of `@mui/data-grid` in more detail [here](https://mui.com/x/api/data-grid/data-grid/).

Here is an example.

```javascript
<DeleteOnlyDataGrid
  columns={columns}
  rows={rows}
  onDeleteRow={onDeleteRow}
  selectionModel={selectionModel} // this props comes from @mui/x-data-grid
  loading={loading} // this props comes from @mui/x-data-grid
/>
```

#### @mui/x-data-grid

[@mui/x-data-grid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mui/x-data-grid) is a data grid library for React users, created by the Material UI team. It features powerful filtering, sorting, and pagination functionality, as well as customizable column headers and cell rendering. Its API is extremely flexible, enabling users to implement various use cases without much difficulty. The library is built with performance in mind, making it an excellent choice for handling large datasets or complex UI scenarios.
